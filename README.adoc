Welcome to the hands-on workshop! Each of these tasks is designed to give you hands-on experience with different aspects of Antora.

== Tasks

. xref:./task1-customize-playbook/README.adoc[*Customize the playbook*]
   - Learn how to adjust the Antora playbook to customize which modules are built, change the output directory, and control logging levels to *speed up local builds* and reduce unnecessary output.

. xref:./task2-author-mode/README.adoc[*Set up author mode*]
   - This task will guide you through setting up author mode in Antora, allowing you to *work on multiple branches of the same repository locally*. You'll also learn how to configure Git worktrees to streamline managing content from different branches in your workspace.

. xref:./task3-troubleshoot-build/README.adoc[*Troubleshoot a broken build*]
   - This task will teach you how to *diagnose and resolve common build issues* by reading the error logs and fixing broken configurations, such as missing components or cross-references.

. xref:./task4-add-new-product/README.adoc[*Add a new product component*]
   - This task involves *creating a new product in the documentation* by adding a new component, configuring its structure in the playbook, and building the site to verify the new content appears as expected.

. xref:./task5-add-new-macro/README.adoc[*Create a basic macro*]
   - In this task, you'll explore a basic JavaScript macro for Antora that *adds dynamic content to your documentation*. You'll also learn how to integrate this macro into the build.

---

For each task, follow the provided step-by-step instructions in the respective folders. By the end of the workshop, you'll be comfortable with customizing Antora's configuration, troubleshooting build issues, extending functionality with macros, and adding new products to the documentation.
