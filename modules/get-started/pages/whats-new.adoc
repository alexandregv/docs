== Mountable topics

For topics with Tiered Storage enabled, you can xref:manage:mountable-topics.adoc[unmount a topic] to detach segment data that is still on disk to object storage, and you can mount a topic from object storage to attach the topic data to either the same origin cluster or a different one. This allows you to hibernate a topic and free up and reclaim system resources taken up by the topic, or you can migrate a topic to a different cluster.

== Leader pinning

For a Redpanda cluster deployed across multiple availability zones (AZs), xref:develop:produce-data/leader-pinning.adoc[leader pinning] ensures that a topic's partition leaders are geographically closer to clients. Leader pinning can lower networking costs and help guarantee lower latency by routing produce and consume requests to brokers located in certain AZs.

== License enforcement

Enterprise license enforcement begins with release 24.3. If you are using an xref:get-started:licenses.adoc#redpanda-enterprise-edition[enterprise feature] without an Enterprise license, you will not be able to upgrade to 24.3 until you provide a license key.
