= Task 5: Create a Basic Macro

In this task, you'll create a basic custom macro for Antora and integrate it into the build.

== Learning objectives

- Gain hands-on experience creating basic macros that manipulate content during the build.
- Learn how to use custom macros to add dynamic content, such as generating timestamps or formatting blocks in your docs.

== Steps

. Open the `scripts/hello-macro.js` file and review the simple macro that outputs a greeting message.
+
  ```javascript
  module.exports.register = function (registry) {
    registry.blockMacro('hello', function () {
      this.process(function (parent, target, attrs) {
        return this.createBlock(parent, 'paragraph', 'Hello, ' + target + '!');
      });
    });
  };
  ```

. Modify local-antora-playbook.yml to include this macro:
+
```yaml
asciidoc:
  extensions:
    - ./scripts/hello-macro.js
```

. In one of the local Asciidoc files, add a line using the macro:
+
```asciidoc
hello::world[]
```

. Run the build:
+
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

. Verify that the macro correctly outputs "Hello, world!" in the generated documentation.

== Bonus steps

- Extend the macro to accept additional attributes or parameters.
- Test the macro by using it in different parts of your documentation.
