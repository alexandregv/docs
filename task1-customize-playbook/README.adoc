= Task 1: Customize the Playbook

In this task, you will customize the playbook to build only local content.

== Learning objectives

- Learn how to modify Antora's playbook to customize which content sources are built.
- Practice limiting the content to specific components and adjusting the output location to optimize local build times.
- Learn how to change the log levels to reduce unnecessary noise during local builds.

== Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed. You can verify its installation by running:

[source,bash]
----
node --version
----

If Node.js is not installed, https://nodejs.org/[download and install it].

== Steps

. Change into the `task1-customize-playbook/` directory.
. Clone the `docs` repository.
. Open `local-antora-playbook.yml`.
. Modify the `content.sources` to limit the build to your local content only.
. Run the build:
+
You'll see lots of errors related to broken links in the logs. You're seeing these errors because the content links to components or modules that are no longer part of the playbook. You can ignore these logs while you're working on the content locally.
. Change the runtime log level so that you see less noise in the logs:
